Japan Castle in the Sky airing broke a Twitter record on August 3, 2013. At one
point during the classic anime movie showing, people submitted 143,199 tweets
per second. This particular spike was about 25 times greater than Twitterâ€™s
steady state.

Given an array of integers representing the number of tweets recorded every
second and an integer value K, your task is to write a function that prints to
the standard output (stdout) the highest number of tweets recorded between each
second in the array and the past K seconds before it.

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
- tps: which is an array of integers representing the number of tweets recorded
  every second
- k: which is the integer number mentioned above

Data constraints:
- the length of the array above will not exceed 500,000 numbers

Efficiency constraints
- your function is expected to print the requested result and return in less
  than 2 seconds
