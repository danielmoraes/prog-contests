Given an integer number N.

Your task is to:
 - write a function that prints to the standard output (stdout) the numbers from
   1 to N (one per line) with the following restrictions:
   - for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
   - for the multiples of five print “Buzz” instead of the number
   - for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”

Note that your function will receive the following arguments:
- n: which is the integer number described above

Data constraints:
- the maximum value of N will not exceed 1000

Efficiency constraints:
- your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds
