The Wall Street in New York is known for its breathtaking skyscrapers. But the
raining season is approaching, and the amount of water that will fall over the
buildings is going to be huge this year. Since every building is stuck to the
buildings to its left and to its right (except for the first and the last one),
the water can leak from a building only if the height of the building is higher
than the height of the building to its left or to its right (the height of the
edges of Wall Street is 0). All the buildings have the width of 1 meter.

You are given the heights (in meters) of the buildings on Wall Street from left
to right, and your task is to print to the standard output (stdout) the total
amount of water (in cubic meters) held over the buildings on Wall Street.

Example input:
- heights: 9 8 7 8 9 5 6

Example output:
- 5

Explanation:
In this example, between the first and the fifth building there are held 4 cubic
meters of water (1 over the second, 2 over the third, and 1 over the fourth),
and between the fifth and the seventh building there is 1 cubic meter of water
held (over the sixth building).
