Given an integer number N, compute its square root without using any math
library functions and print the result to standard output. Please round the
result downwards to the nearest integer (e.g both 7.1 and 7.9 are rounded to 7)

Expected complexity: O(logN), O(1)

Example input:
N: 17

Example output:
4
